I will have to punt the second part of this assignment. Last week my dad had to go to the hosptial for internal bleeding causing me to fall behind. It appears I will not be able to catch up. 

What works: 
log in and basic chat functionality

What needs to be added: 
Model needs to be fixed to include: 
- chats
    -   messages
        - text
        - timestamp
        - user
        - userid
- groups/channel
    - name
- users
    - groups
        - group key
    - name
Dynamic links need to be generated for each channel
